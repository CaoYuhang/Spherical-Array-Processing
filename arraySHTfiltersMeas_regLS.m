%ARRAYSHTFILTERSMEAS_REGLS Generate SHT filters based on measured responses
%(regularized least-squares)
%
%   Generate the filters to convert micorphone signals from a spherical
%   microphone array to SH signals, based on a least-squares solution with
%   a constraint on noise amplification, using Tikhonov regularization. The
%   method formulates the LS problem in the space domain, using the
%   directional measurements of the array response, similar to e.g.
%
%       Moreau, S., Daniel, J., Bertet, S., 2006, 
%       3D sound field recording with higher order ambisonics-objective 
%       measurements and validation of spherical microphone. 
%       In Audio Engineering Society Convention 120.
%
%   Inputs:
%       H_array:    nFFT x nMics x nMeasurement_dirs matrix of measured
%           responses, in the frequency domain with length nFFT
%       order_sht:  order of SH signals to generate
%       grid_dirs:  nMeasurement_dirs x 2 matrix of [azi elev] of the
%           measurement directions, in rads
%       w_grid:     nMeasurement_dirs x 1 vector of weights for
%           weighted-least square solution, based on the importance or area
%           around each measurement point (leave empty if not known, or
%           not important)
%       nFFT:       number of FFT points in the responses
%       amp_threshold:  max allowed amplification for filters, in dB
%
%   Outputs:
%       H_filt: nSH x nMics x (nFFT/2+1) returned filters in the frequency 
%           domain (half spectrum up to Nyquist)
%       h_filt: nFFT x nMics x nSH impulse responses of the above filters
